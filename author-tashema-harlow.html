    "body": "2019/12/22 - Winter is my favourite season, without a doubt. The snow makeseverything look so picturesque and the break is right on our doorstep. However, for some people, the holidays are dull, with no school tooccupy their days, and friends gone on vacations. But fear not, thereare still so many things to do.  Anything snow-related: Take advantage of the season and get outthere. Build a snowman, go sledding or skating, or have a snowballfight. Winter is also the time to ski, or try something moreoutlandish, like ice fishing or snow sculpting. One of my favouritethings to do is build a snow fort with my friends. ¬† Indoor activities: However fun it is to play in the snow, it‚Äôscold. But inside, you can make crafts (a great gift idea), catch upon your reading, draw (the snowy landscape will provide lots ofinspiration), or learn to cook something new. Also, drink hotchocolate, especially after playing in the snow (that‚Äôs the besttime to drink it).  Go to a concert: There are lots of concerts in December, manywith holiday themes. So whether you‚Äôd like to go see your favouriteartist, or maybe go somewhere new, there will definitely besomething to peak your interest.  Catch up with old friends: I have many friends from elementaryschool who I haven‚Äôt seen in a long time. The break is a great timeto reach out and plan a time to get together. And if you don‚Äôt knowwhat to do when you see them, perhaps you should try something fromthis list. Happy holidays!Image source:  MerryChristmas! ¬†by¬†xymox¬†islicensed under¬†CC BY-NC-ND2. 0¬† "

    "body": "2019/12/16 - If you‚Äôre not already aware, we are living in an age where everything isavailable at our fingertips. News, entertainment, music, etc. - withjust the push of a button it‚Äôs all there. However, with this newfoundfreedom comes a price that I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre already aware of. What we sayonline is usually different, sometimes to an extreme, than what we sayin real life. Most of the warnings that we hear about online safetyinclude never giving away your personal information, or being mindful ofwhat it is you‚Äôre saying. But what we don‚Äôt hear about as often is howyour personality itself can change. ¬† Let‚Äôs say that you‚Äôre on an app that connects you to other people (yourfriends, family, even strangers), and you suddenly see something thatinterests you. Immediately you feel the need to comment something, rightthen. The world must know about what you have to say. So, you type aquick comment. Soon, you get a reply and are suddenly having aconversation on a topic that you, in fact, don‚Äôt really know much about. So what do you do? Keep having the conversation? It seems as thoughthere‚Äôs no other choice. You can‚Äôt just log off and leave peoplehanging. So you keep talking, thinking it doesn‚Äôt matter. Who cares ifyou‚Äôre wrong? This very well might not be you. But the truth is, some people just feelthe need to talk, so, knowing that they‚Äôll never actually meet theperson they‚Äôre talking to and knowing they‚Äôre not going to have toactually face the consequences of giving said person misinformation,they just keep going. This is really something you need to be watchfulof. Telling other people something that isn‚Äôt true and presenting it asfact can mislead lots of people, and can also harm your reputation. Or maybe, instead of talking off the top of your head, you speak inextremes. You might say that you hate something that you see, but reallyjust mildly dislike it. Or perhaps you see something that makes youchuckle a bit, and then say that it was so funny that you were dying oflaughter. ¬† Exaggerating is an easy thing to do on the internet. You want people tolike what you say, to agree with you. So instead of giving an honestreply, you turn your comment into something it‚Äôs not, solely for thesake of making more people agree with you. This isn‚Äôt a really terriblething, but try to keep it real. While it‚Äôs okay to exaggerate a bit, youmight end up having a real conversation when you dial it down a fewnotches too. The last thing people do online is be completely silent. Now this maynot sound as bad, and it isn‚Äôt a big problem, especially compared to theother things I‚Äôve been writing about. But you do have social media tobe, well, social. Don‚Äôt be so afraid to say something that it keeps youfrom saying anything entirely. A good thing to keep in mind wheninteracting with others on the internet is to say something positive, asopposed to negative. And if someone says something negative to you, tryto be mature. You don‚Äôt have to reply, but if you do, make sure that youaren‚Äôt being rude or impolite. The best thing to do is just let it go. You didn‚Äôt do anything wrong, the other person did, so don‚Äôt let thembother you. All in all, just pay attention to what exactly it is that you‚Äôre sayingonline. It‚Äôs quite easy to misinterpret what anyone could say when it‚Äôswritten down, as you don‚Äôt have facial expressions or emphasis to guideyou. So be careful, and try to assume the best. You catch more flieswith honey than vinegar. "

    "body": "2019/12/06 - A lot happens in a year. Each person undergoes easy and hard times,facing both triumph and defeat. This makes up for the time spentthinking, working, and scrambling to get through it all. By December,many people are exhausted, and wish to start over. Awaiting them is anew year. The prospect of something new makes us feel like there‚Äôsnothing we can‚Äôt do, because anything is possible for the future. Thus,we reflect on our past year, and figure out what to do differently fromnow on. With this come our resolutions. People get excited about thechanges they will make to better themselves and their lives. Many can‚Äôtwait for New Years, and all the apparent bliss that comes with it. However, after New Years, what happens to these resolutions? According to Forbes, studies have shown that less than 25% ofindividuals stay committed to their New Year's Resolutions after just30 days, and only 8% actually accomplish them. These statisticsgive rise to the question: why don‚Äôt people keep their resolutions? People tend to fall back into old habits. After the atmosphere ofoptimism surrounding New Years is gone, people will return to the samelifestyles they led before without a thought. Even if they want to alteran aspect of their life, they will live in the same way, and forgetabout their resolutions. Also, we forget that making changes in life takes effort. A lot ofpeople are not willing to try for the small things they want. Stickingto a resolution is easier said than done, and people feel better notattempting something, than trying and possibly failing. Lastly, there is not much motivation to go through with one‚Äôsresolutions. New Years is smack in the middle of winter, which is aseason of comfort. The feelings of laziness and sleepiness we feel makeit difficult to want to do anything. This is especially true if yourresolution includes getting out of the house. It is easy to get temptedby a warm sofa or a new Netflix movie instead of stepping out into thesnow. Image source:  Happy NewYear  bynigelhowe is licensedunder CC BY-NC 2. 0 "

    "body": "2019/11/12 - November: A Time to be Empowered Rhea Matharu Grade 11 Copy Editor &amp; Production Head I believe, in order to be empowered to take action about this unrevealed(for now) issue, you will need to be in a different perspective. Closeyour eyes and read the following. You begin as a piece of cheap fabric that required 2700 litres of water(an average person drinks this in 2. 5 years). The workers are tired,struggling with scars on their hands, to piece you together for a livingwage. However, you are only one of many. About 140 billiongarments *are manufactured each year. The amount of resources spent onyou account for nothing as you have a short lifespan. Your impact? Youproduced 1. 2 billion tonnes of CO2 (per year), yet end up in a landfillproducing more methane. * This horrifying perspective effectively portrays the product life cyclethat a fast fashion piece of garment experiences. This exposes theperceived benefit of $20 jeans that last for a very short amount oftime due to its cheap materials. This short lifespan is largely becauseof brands like Forever21, Zara, and H&amp;M wanting to match the growingdemand for new, trendy clothing, resulting in new clothing designs andstyles being created every few weeks! Instead of two season cycles,there are at least 52 seasons for clothing in the fast fashion industry. Now that you have learned about the harms of the fashion industry, learnabout what you, the consumer, can do to help.  Reduce the amount of clothing you buy from fast fashion stores, or     even better, stop shopping there altogether. Shop from thriftstores or stores that sustainably produce their items. Thedecreasing demand is sure to change their manufacturing processes.     Instead of throwing out your clothing, donate it to stores that     accept them or your friends/family. Before buying your clothes,make sure you know that you will wear it a significant amount oftimes.       Reach out to these fast fashion brands to express your concerns.   Spread awareness to people you know to expose the hidden truths     behind these companies.    This November, empower yourself and others to create less carbonemissions. The fast fashion industry is one of the largest contributors,if not the largest, to climate change. Surprisingly, it is not one thatpeople think of. It‚Äôs harm on the planet and terrible working conditionsin factories must be put to an end. "

    "title": "The Reasoning Behind Spider-Man‚Äôs Exit from the MCU",
    "body": "2019/11/10 - If you‚Äôre a Marvel fan like me, then you‚Äôve probably heard about therecent drama between Sony and Disney regarding Spider-Man. If youhaven‚Äôt heard about what is happening, here‚Äôs a summary. Sony has ownedthe film rights to Spider-Man since 1998. In 2015, they made a deal withDisney, agreeing to lend the character of Spider-Man to Marvel Studios,a company owned by Disney, and to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. As wehave seen over the last few years, Tom Holland‚Äôs Spider Man has played alarge role in many Marvel movies. Recently, Sony and Disney haverevisited their deal, and gone through negotiations about future stepsfor the Spider-Man character. On August 20th, 2019, Sony announced thatKevin Feige, president of Marvel Studios, won‚Äôt be playing a role in theproduction of the next Spider-Man film. This means that Spider-Man iscurrently not a part of the MCU anymore. This news left fans feelingboth angry and heartbroken, since Marvel‚Äôs latest movie, ‚ÄúSpider-Man:Far From Home‚Äù had set up Spider-Man to be the new face of thefranchise. Upon hearing about this, I didn‚Äôt understand what happenedbetween the two major companies, and wanted to know the reason behindthe decisions being made. ¬† Sony owns the rights to Spider-Man and gets to keep them as long as theymake a new Spider-Man movie every five to six years. They started with‚ÄúSpider-Man‚Äù in 2002, starring Tobey Maguire. After its success, theyproceeded to release ‚ÄúSpider-Man 2‚Äù, and then ‚ÄúSpider-Man 3‚Äù in 2007. The third movie didn‚Äôt do quite as well as hoped, costing $260 millionto make, with profits dipping significantly from the first two movies. ¬† Five years later, Sony decided to reboot the series, and released ‚ÄúTheAmazing Spider-Man‚Äù starring Andrew Garfield. This movie made over $700million worldwide. With its success,‚ÄùThe Amazing Spider-Man 2‚Äù was made. Unfortunately, it did not live up to Sony‚Äôs expectations, with the veryhigh production costs and lessened excitement from fans. ¬† Because of their failed attempts, Sony struck a deal with Disney in  Marvel would be able to use Spider-Man in their cinematicuniverse, while Sony kept distribution rights and creative control. Sonyproducer, Amy Pascal, who played a big role in the creation of theSpider-Man movies since 2002, produced  Spider-Man: Homecoming  and Spider-Man: Far From Home  with Kevin Feige. This deal had beenupheld by both sides, until Sony decided to revisit the idea of makingtheir own Spider-Man films. ¬†Recently, Sony has been doing well with their own ‚ÄòUniverse of MarvelCharacters‚Äô. ‚ÄúVenom‚Äù made over $800 million worldwide after beingreleased in 2018, and ‚ÄúSpider-Man: Far From Home‚Äù made over $1 billionthis summer. These successes have been ‚Äújust the rebound Sony needed. ‚ÄùSpider-Man is Sony‚Äôs greatest property, and they are highly motivated tokeep it in their control. . This is why they had such an interest intaking back the character. Another reason why the deal was beingrevisited was because Disney wanted a 50/50 stake in future Spider-Man  movies. Sony wanted to keep the deal as is: where Marvelreceives up to 5% of first-dollar gross and all merchandising revenue. As of right now, no new deal has been made. This indicates that unlesssomething changes, Marvel Studios will not be involved in the making ofnew Spider-Man movies, and no MCU characters will be referenced. Sonyhopes that Director John Watts and star Tom Holland will return for twomore Spider-Man films. Even though this feels like a big loss for fans,we should remember that there are still more movies being made, and eventhough Marvel seems to be out of Spider-Man's life right now, Sony ishopeful that a deal could still be made in the future. ¬† *Note: This article was written before the agreement between Sony andDisney to keep Spiderman in the MCU was reached.

The war was a result of many factors, including politicaltension and military alliances. The assassination of Archduke FranzFerdinand of Austria in 1914 sparked the beginning of a crisis and thewar began that same year in August. It would become a bloody four yearwar with close to 61,000 Canadians killed. Originally the day was called ‚ÄúArmistice Day‚Äù to commemorate thearmistice agreement which ended the war on Monday, November 11, 1918, at11 a. m, the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month. ¬† Vimy Ridge Considered Canada‚Äôs most celebrated Canadian military victory, thebattle of Vimy Ridge was fought from the 9th to 12th of April 1917 onthe Western Front of northern France. Four divisions of the CanadianCorps fought united and captured the ridge from the German army. It wasthe largest territorial advance of any Allied force at that point in thewar. Unfortunately the cost of the victory was overwhelming; more than10,600 Canadians were killed or wounded in the battle. Today a memorialstands at the top of the ridge to honour the 11,285 Canadians killed inFrance throughout the war who have no marked graves. Remembering¬† The day serves to remember all the lives that were lost in the line ofduty and the countless sacrifices soldiers made to uphold internationalpeace.
