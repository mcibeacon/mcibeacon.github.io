grass? This is just one of many signs the summer months are within
reach. With summer approaching, you may notice a shift in your overall
mood. We all feel a certain weight has been lifted off our shoulders
when the weather begins to warm up (and it’s not just the lack of weight
from thick winter jackets!). There is a direct correlation between
summer weather and a better state of mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, summer means longer days and brighter sunlight, so there’s more
time to enjoy everything these months have to offer. These extended
hours of sunlight give us more vitamin D, a nutrient that helps with the
absorption of calcium and phosphorus. Vitamin D, also known as the
“sunshine vitamin”, raises our energy levels, making us feel happier and
less tired. A large percentage of Canadians ages 12-19 receive below the
recommended amount of vitamin D, classified as almost vitamin D
deficient. Vitamin D deficiency symptoms include fatigue, muscle
weakness, and depression. Being outside during the summer months is a
way to regain the vitamin D we’ve been missing during winter. It helps
not only brighten our backyards, but our own moods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to research from the University of Michigan, warm and sunny
weather can improve attitude, memory, and provide openness to creative
thoughts and new information. Their findings suggested that two crucial
variables affect mood: how much time you spend outside and what season
it is. If an individual usually spends a good amount of time outside,
and the season has changed from winter to summer, a noticeable change
can occur. In one study, participants across the United States were
randomly assigned to be outdoors during warm, sunny days. The results
showed that these individuals had an improved mood and memory, compared
to those who were outside during poor weather and those who stayed
indoors. Interestingly, the researchers also found the ideal temperature
for people to be 72 degrees Fahrenheit, or about 22 degrees Celsius. It
was concluded that for weather to improve mood, one needs to spend at
least 30 minutes outside in warm weather per day. Individuals who stay
indoors when the weather is nice outside experience a decrease in
overall mood, and a narrowed cognitive style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, the pleasant weather during summer provides incentive to be
more physically active. Whether this involves going for walks, bike
rides, playing sports, or working out, an increase in temperature makes
it both easier and more enjoyable to get outside and move. Especially in
milder summer temperatures, people tend to express feelings of joy and
optimism. With the provincial restrictions beginning to loosen as well,
we are able to inch even closer to normal. There is no doubt that
previously negative moods, in large part due to the cold weather and
lengthy lockdowns, will begin to shift this summer due to the warm
weather. So when you look outside to see the green grass and shining
sun, remember to enjoy the mental benefits that come with this lovely
time of year!&lt;/p&gt;

Indigenous Women and Girls crisis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;B.C. Gathering for families of missing and murdered Indigenous women
and girls (BC Gov Photos)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each day, every Indigenous woman wakes up to a nightmare. Otherwise,
known as the dark reality of Canada. A reality where Indigenous women
are &lt;strong&gt;12 times more likely&lt;/strong&gt; to go missing or be killed. A reality where
&lt;strong&gt;300 Indigenous women&lt;/strong&gt; go missing in a year- of the known cases at
least. However, this reality is masked with racism, ignorance, and
largely, lack of awareness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Colonialism’s Lasting Effects&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The root of the ongoing racialization and sexualization of Indigenous
women is no doubt connected to colonialism. It parallels the development
of Canada itself, with the topic of settler colonialism being common
amongst both. Colonists normalized violence against Indigenous women and
families with the support of policies they created such as forced
sterilization and losing their status if they married a non-Status
Indigenous man. These policies served to limit Indigenous women’s access
to community resources and safety networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Guthrie Valaskakis, a leading authority on Aboriginal Media
and Communication, states that early colonial writing depicted
Indigenous women as “Indian princesses” that were fetching, proud, and
virtuous. The resistance to such views further catalyzed negative
perspectives on Indigenous women. They became known as “squaws” that
were dirty, lewd, uncivilized, and sexually deviant. This “heirloom” of
intergenerational trauma is passed down through Indigenous families,
often in the form of post-traumatic stress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Burden of Today&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aforementioned characterizations of Indigenous women certainly exist
to this day. Thus, the grotesque violence that is covered for merely one
Grade 6 class still continues today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fear and intergenerational trauma that Indigenous women and girls
are burdened with have forced them to use coping strategies that
increase their vulnerability to violence. These include hitchhiking,
addictions, homelessness, and more. Perhaps one has seen these terms
veiled as causes for their disappearances, when the real culprit,
colonization, is stored away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is the Government Helping?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer to this is simply revealed in the negative effects of the
Indian Act of 1876. Though published over a century ago, it is still in
existence today. It is known that this sole piece of legislation
restricted Indigenous people of their basic human rights. Relating to
the matter of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls, the
Indian Act largely supports - and arguably has created - the
discrimination and racism prevalent against Indigenous peoples today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Primarily, the Indian Act is not inclusive when it comes to matrimonial
real property (e.g. family home) on reserve land in the case of a
marriage ending. Nothing in the Act affects title to reserve lands. As
well, the rules on matrimonial property do not apply to First Nations
that have signed the Framework Agreement on First Nations Land
Management or those who have self-government arrangements. This lack of
legal clarity and protection makes women who have been experiencing
violence or recently widowed prone to losing their homes on the reserve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, even one’s home is not a sustainable option when escaping from
violent and unsafe situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, one might argue that the government continues to promise to bring
justice to this issue. However, like any other contemporary issue, it is
part of a political agenda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Three-Year Effort Down the Drain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An important and highly regarded document called the National Inquiry on
Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls was published June 3,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It concluded that years of systemic racism and human rights
violations were a significant factor in the deaths and disappearances of
hundreds of Indigenous women and girls. However, this call for action
has continually been delayed by the government.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Families, communities, and allies have not received any information
about what governments – either federal or provincial – have been
doing over the past year on this file,” said Meggie Cywink, whose sister
disappeared on her respective birthday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No glimpse of solace has been provided to affected families; they are
left with grief and mocked with the government’s inaction. Even so, the
COVID-19 pandemic has been used as an excuse for inaction. This is
highly redundant as Indigenous women are at greater risk of violence due
to the isolation measures in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The extensive report has created a descriptive framework and plan of
action for the country, yet the government fails to act on it. It lists
much-needed initiatives such as: legislation to preserve Indigenous
languages; giving Indigenous communities control over their
child-welfare systems; dealing with gender discrimination in the Indian
Act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The genocide that exists today is at the hands of the Canadian
government. Each life is being dissolved into yet another statistic. It
sounds an alarm for action but it is deafened with systemic racism and
decades of oppression. Canada, please listen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rhea: This is an amazing article. Eloquent, passionate, forceful. It
makes for very compelling reading. Very mature and thorough writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My only caution is: you don’t need the bitterness (flinch, not even a
glance) to still make an extremely strong argument. It comes off better
without resorting to a very personal level of attack. I totally agree
with you on the facts and without the vitriol.&lt;/p&gt;

horizon. With more and more Canadians getting vaccinated, and COVID-19
rates dropping dramatically, the return to a normal life in the near
future finally seems possible. According to &lt;em&gt;Our World in Data&lt;/em&gt;, Canada
recently beat out Israel. This makes us the global leader in first
vaccination rates, with 64 percent to their 63 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When rollouts started in developed countries just a few months ago, it
was hard to imagine we’d reach this point. Canada’s vaccine rollout was
hardly something to be proud of. Back at the start of March, only 4
percent of people in Canada were vaccinated, in comparison to 15.2
percent in the United States, and 55 percent in Israel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The turnaround started around April. This was when the rate of
vaccinations greatly increased, with around 188,000 people receiving
vaccines each day. Today, our rate is 375,000 people a day - which is
roughly one percent of our population and the highest pace of any
country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what changed? The government’s access has been the largest
contributing factor. The Canadian government was largely reliant on
countries such as the U.S. and the U.K. for vaccine supply- but they
were busy supplying their own populations with vaccines made in their
own plants. Canada’s inability to secure vaccines early on in the
process had an adverse impact on our vaccination rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, there are millions of vaccines coming into Canada now, and
first-dose vaccinations have continued at a steady rate, with pop-up and
mass vaccination clinics aiding the impressive rollout of recent weeks.
American cardiologist Eric Topol credits the “culture” of Canada for the
impressive shift, saying that Canadians are more science-based and less
likely to be “anti-vaxx” than those in his country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canada’s strategy - of vaccinating as many people with their first dose
and delaying the second dose - means we have one of the lowest ratios of
first doses to second doses in the world. However, there is some
evidence that giving more Canadians partial protection has contributed
to ensuring less people were impacted by the surging third wave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As more people in Canada become fully vaccinated, we can aim our sights
on the return to a normal future. All levels of the Canadian government
are under pressure to give clear guidelines on restrictions that can be
lifted for people who are fully vaccinated, in a similar manner that The
United States’ Centre for Disease Control did. While the Public Health
Agency of Canada says it will offer some guidance eventually, for now,
the provinces are largely on their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently in Ontario, fully vaccinated Canadians are expected to follow
the same social distancing rules as non-vaccinated people, though the
Chief Medical Officer of the province is working with experts on rules
for the fully vaccinated. With the increased vaccination rates for both
first and second doses, it is likely that a return to normal will come
sooner rather than later.&lt;/p&gt;

for the Beacon in grade 9 and is now my final contribution to the club.
We’re bringing it full circle folks!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’ll pass it on to grade-9-Surbhi. We’ll talk again at the end.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the summer, family and friends would ask me what grade I was in,
so I’d tell them I was going to start ninth grade. I’d always get the
same reaction, “So you’re starting &lt;em&gt;high school.&lt;/em&gt; Are you ready?” I
wouldn’t know how to respond because I didn’t know anything about high
school. My perception of high school was based on all the things my
middle school teachers warned me about - the workload, strict teachers,
and tall grade twelves - but getting used to all of those was easy
compared to &lt;em&gt;the desks.&lt;/em&gt; Don’t get me wrong, I think these desks are
amazing in many ways - their tables slightly tilted to the perfect angle
for frantically finishing your third test of the day, their beautiful
fluoride-green hue, and the footrest under the seats, just the right
size for the books you keep in your bag - but &lt;em&gt;built-in&lt;/em&gt; chairs?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know I’m not the only one who struggled with the chairs being attached
to the desks. I vividly remember the first few days of school when the
dismissal bell was followed by the sound of twenty-five chair-desk
hybrids scraping against the floor, and the sight of twenty-five
students shifting backwards in unison. We could no longer simply scoot
our chairs back and stand; instead, we had to snake our way through the
maze created by our desk and the one adjacent. It seemed to me that
after a while, everyone else had moved on and it was only my lone
squeaky struggles echoing through the empty classroom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Signs of growth are already evident in the class of 2021; today, I hear
no sounds of those trying to wriggle free from their desk. We’ve done
it. I find myself starting to love what I used to hate about the desks;
the chair being attached to the desk may be inconvenient when trying to
leave, but I love the innovative 2-in-1 furniture concept. In some way,
it makes me feel secure and protected. These desks are no longer
obstacles in my mind. I’m starting to feel like a real bear. Now I just
need to figure out where my geography class is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note from grade-12-Surbhi:&lt;/strong&gt; Hello again! Though we haven’t gotten to
see our beloved cross-bred seats much this year, I hope you could still
relate to this article.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To the class of 2021: congratulations! I hope you recognize that
whatever your fears and struggles may have been leaving middle school,
you did it. And when you leave high school, you’ll do it again.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

in-person time at the school, I wanted to take a moment to journey all
throughout the Martingrove lifestyle. Here is a recounting of all the
little, unique features that fill the school with life and personality,
making it a vibrant and interesting place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 1: The Timeless Opportunities for Thrill Seeking and Spiritual
Enlightenment:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we all know, Martingrove’s in-person classes begin at 8:45 in the
morning. In fact, a couple years back, the school even had its own
standard time, independent from geolocation, where all of the clocks in
the school were set 2 minutes ahead of the rest of Ontario. Whether or
not this was intentional, it definitely made getting to school in the
morning an even more adventurous affair…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are often those people who arrive at school with 5 minutes left to
rush to their locker and then to class. The excitement of living on the
edge when arriving late to school helps wake them up in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, if you do happen to arrive late, you must go through a humbling
ritual of standing still in the hallway, facing the uncanny smile of the
supervising teacher during the playing of &lt;em&gt;O Canada&lt;/em&gt;. In a way, this
makes for a bit of spiritual enlightenment. The national anthem echoing
throughout the vestibule and the murmuring of fellow students creates an
almost serene atmosphere, prone to inner self-reflection. Many students
were there once, standing in shame, repenting their tardy crimes, asking
Marty the Bear for forgiveness and most importantly, hoping for enough
strength to make it to class before the matinal announcements finish and
they are marked late.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 2: The Local Food Hotspots&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the focal points of the MCI morning rush is the large amounts of
delicious breakfast snacks. Many will be familiar with the world-famous
MCI &lt;em&gt;Cheese Bread&lt;/em&gt;©, fruits, Melba toast, cheerio packages, and
straight-up loaves of bread that sit in the office hallway, constantly
eyed and picked up by the students throughout the day. Some may have
heard of the school’s cafeteria where you can buy a hearty meal at
lunch. We also cannot forget about our local Metro or Tim Horton’s. But
did you know that Martingrove used to have its own school snack store…
and even a hot dog stand?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, dearest Bear’s Den, you are still missed! The school’s widely famous
snack store had to close down in 2017. But before it met an untimely
end, it lived a glorious life. Pop, chips, and chocolate galore, Bear’s
Den held everything needed for a Martingrove student to fuel themselves
during the day. Situated in the booth in the southwest corner of the
school’s foyer, the colourful tint of the snack packaging attracted many
Bears hoping to satisfy their sweet tooth. Soon after, the Bears became
bees, as the sugar highs asserted their dominance, and students began to
buzz around the school, making for a vibrant afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would be remiss not to mention our beloved Jerry, who animated and lit
up the front of the school every lunch when he arrived to sell his
wonderful hot dogs and beverages. Lines formed in front of him even
longer than those for Bear’s Den, stretching from the street all the way
back to the school’s doors. Unfortunately, at the same time as the
banning of Bear’s Den, Jerry’s presence in front of MCI became a memory.
However, we have been informed by a trusty source that he was seen
outside another high school in Toronto, bringing happiness to new faces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 3: The Secret Math Textbook Office&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MCI has a second story, but do you know just how big it really is? We
all assume it ends with the classrooms. However, if you can get your
hands on a map of the school, you’ll see that on the east side of the
second floor, behind the photocopier room is a seemingly unsuspecting
door. Little did we know that the math textbook storage room was looming
right behind it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, this would not be a very interesting part of Martingrove if it was
just a regular old storage room, however our sources have managed to
find a copy of the school’s floor plan. They have found out that the
Math textbook room happens to be huge. It makes you wonder if there are
really that many textbooks to store in there…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We here at the Beacon have a connection to an investigative journalist
who was able to get a glimpse on the inside. According to them, it was
filled with rows and rows of intimidating textbooks, but they insist
that this is a cover-up. Our connection had with them a radiation
detector which reported traces of Hawking’s radiation deeper in the
room. We here at the Beacon have reasons to believe that secret research
projects are currently taking place in MCI’s math textbook room that
study the nature of gravity in an effort to create a wormhole to a
different universe. Knowing how heavy most of the math textbooks are,
this does not seem far off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 4: The Best Parts of the Music Hallway&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We shall not forget the Strings and Band rooms with the memorabilia on
the walls, pictures of generations and generations of virtuoso students
and competition trophies won year after year by the pupils of Mr.
Stoica, Ms. McAskill and, in the future, pupils of Ms. Chang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is something inspiring in the way the instruments line up along
the walls like well-trained soldiers. The old piano tells stories of
students playing Fur Elise during impromptu concerts during breaks
between rehearsals. Mr. Stoica’s bubble gum dispenser sat in the corner
of the strings room, always mysteriously filled in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next door is the auditorium, a witness of glorious Winter and Spring
concerts, galas, and ceremonies year after year for welcoming new
students, graduations, and commencements. Walking now on the eery silent
hallways one could imagine hearing the cheerful voices of generations
and generations of teenagers full of hopes and dreams who coloured the
walls and ceilings with their liveliness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 5: The Fitting Meaning of MCI’s Motto&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What would a recounting of all things MCI be without mentioning our
school’s windowless nature? Window jokes have become a centerpiece in
the Martingrove lore. Many origin stories have been created detailing
how the school’s unique architecture came to be. Some say the lack of
windows was meant as a way of conserving heat during the Torontonian
winters. Others claim the school was once used as a bunker during the
war. One of our very own Beacon writers has written an article about one
of MCI’s most interesting origin stories that you can check out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The truth is that Martingrove is a special school regardless of the
building architecture. There are fabulous teachers and support staff who
are diligently opening windows in students’ minds to create, to
discover, to see the world from different perspectives, and to soar to
the sky. Throughout my time at the school, I have met people with
creative and vibrant personalities, and I have seen active, welcoming
clubs and teams. Altogether, it makes the school stand out because of

&lt;p&gt;I retired last year in 2020. I taught for almost 40 years!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first started teaching in Deva, Romania on September 15, 1981 at a
music and arts school. I taught violin one-on-one, string orchestra, and
chamber music. After a few years, I started to teach viola and a little
bit of contrabass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1996, I came to Canada. I taught private lessons and volunteered at
schools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I started at Martingrove in 2000, I taught one string class, one
vocal class, career studies, and geography. It was difficult because I
had a language barrier - I was fluent in French but not English. Then,
every year I reduced the number of career studies, and geography classes
I taught and grew the string program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.  &lt;strong&gt;What was your favourite part about teaching these subject(s)?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I loved playing and performing. In my interview for the TDSB, I was
asked what I want to do in 5 years. I said, “I want to create one of the
best string programs in Etobicoke.” I accomplished that by creating the
string program at Martingrove.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strings is my life, so I always preferred teaching Strings, but I also
really liked teaching Beginner’s Band. I really liked the sound of the
instruments and the students were very funny. Band was always
interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the best part overall was going on the music trip every other
year and performing at the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.  &lt;strong&gt;Do you have a memory that stands out to you from teaching outside
    of school?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before working at Martingrove, I had 42 private students. My last
student was 62 years old. She asked me if I could teach her to play
carols in three months for her 90-year-old mother. When she played, her
mom was very pleased and sang along. It was very nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4.  &lt;strong&gt;How long have you been playing the violin?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started playing the violin at four and a half.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2021-06-22-Mr.Stoica_Interview0.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image description&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mr. Stoica (right) playing the violin at his first in-school concert in
senior kindergarten.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a picture from my first performance. I didn’t have a stand. The
person standing in front of me was one of my colleagues. They were
supposed to be the same height as me but I was short.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2021-06-22-Mr.Stoica_Interview1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image description&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mr. Stoica (right) dancing in a play in senior kindergarten.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was my first play as a senior kindergartener. Was I a good dancer?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2021-06-22-Mr.Stoica_Interview3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image description&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mr. Stoica playing the violin in grade 2.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was one of my first public performances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5.  &lt;strong&gt;Who is your favourite composer?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, Bach of course. I love Bach. If you listen carefully to everything
he’s writing - whether it’s for orchestra, cello, violin - there’s
always at least one inner melody. No one believed in him while he was
alive. He only became famous after he died. He was teaching people how
to extract three or four melodies at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also like Beethoven because he changed every single style. He
recreated music and opened the door for romantic composers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6.  &lt;strong&gt;What’s your favourite memory from your time at MCI?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best was when we won best of class in a competition against Cardinal
Carter - an arts school where all the music students take private
lessons. We were invited to perform on the same stage where Tafelmusik,
the baroque orchestra, performs. That was fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, all the concerts were fantastic moments for me, as well as being
with students in class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t matter what happened, when I went into the string room and
closed the door, it was a different life for me, like I was Aquaman in
water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7.  &lt;strong&gt;What is your favourite memory from when you were a high school
    student?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last three months of high school were my favourite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were 40 students in our graduating year. We were like a family.
Every weekend in the last month of our final year, my classmates and I
went to each teacher’s house and sang ‘Gaudeamus’ in front of their
house to thank them, a tradition in East Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At prom, we invited all our teachers. At midnight, the orchestra
conductor, one of my favorite teachers, opened the door. He came with
four cases of beer. He opened the door and said, “Starting right now,
you are not students, you are adults. You should share a glass with us
[teachers] and call us by our first names.” It was like he was saying
‘Hey, you’re not kids anymore. Time to go.’ *&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;* The legal drinking age in Romania at the time was 16.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8.  &lt;strong&gt;What do you miss the most about teaching at MCI?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being, playing, and performing with students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I miss the string class, orchestra, concerts, and festivals. Also,
helping students who don’t know how to do something. That I’ll miss a
lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll also miss the chamber ensembles and quartets. They kept me young!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;9.  &lt;strong&gt;What have you enjoyed in your first year of retirement?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a piano in my basement and I’ve been writing the piano part of
some pieces on my computer. I’ve also been arranging Romanian dances for
a string quartet, composing a symphony for strings, practicing violin,
and reading. Also, since my wife is still working from home, I decided
to help her. I’ve been cooking every single day. Now I’m pretty good!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve also been planting tomatoes and I have lots of roses in my
backyard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10.  &lt;strong&gt;Any final words of advice for MCI students?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, I’d like to congratulate all graduating students for
finishing this terrible year. You did amazing work this one and a half
years. Working online on a computer - it’s not human. It’s a great
accomplishment. I wish you luck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To my strings students, I hope you will remember all the advice I gave
you to enjoy life and play. Join a community orchestra and play - you
don’t have to be good, just play. Be in touch with your instrument.
Teach your kids a little bit of music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take care in university. Don’t party too much because it will take your
brain out of what it needs to do. Don’t study too much because you’ll go
crazy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Share what you do with us teachers because we will be proud. And…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2021-06-22-Mr.Stoica_Interview4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image description&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A photo of Mr. Stoica’s Star Wars figures - they move!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;… may the force be with you in university and life!&lt;/p&gt;

with the likes of phones, TVs, and even refrigerators. However, there is
now a new addition to this list: the Levi’s x Google Jacquard. Yes, in
other words, it is a smart jacket. Functions such as double tapping to
change the song and swiping left to answer a call are pretty familiar
among our hands. Now, you can perform them on your own clothing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Levi’s Commuter Trucker x Jacquard jacket is the very first clothing
item designed with Google’s revolutionary smart clothing technology.
Named Project Jacquard, it aims to ease the processes of communication,
navigation, and entertainment for its wearers. This jacket has the
ability to control music, phone calls, get directions, and even receive
Uber alerts. Don’t worry, it is compatible with Bluetooth and its very
own Jacquard App.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The groundbreaking technology relies on the delicacy of the threads as
this touch sensitive technology is woven into it as a piece of fabric.
This piece of fabric operates by using conductive metal threads that are
intertwined with regular fibres to create a new type of fabric that
maintains the normalized look of denim, masking its intelligent
functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, Project Jacquard won’t fall victim to its own brand of
consumer culture that exists in this world today as it has no plans to
open any factories. Instead, they are planning to collaborate on other
designs with brands that are already established as retailers. However,
it may enter with a competitor. Other smart clothing exists! Under
Armour has created the HOVR Sonic Sneaker that tracks performance
statistics during a workout and Wearable X has designed the Nadi X Yoga
Pants to differentiate when the wearer loses proper yoga form during a
session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With smart clothing, the barrier between us and technology is literally
as thin as a thread. Being woven into the very fibres of our clothing,
it brings the question, how connected to technology do we want to be?
Also, is it washing machine safe?&lt;/p&gt;

Regardless of how long you’ve been at MCI, you’ve definitely
noticed that our school lacks a significant thing: windows. We, at the
Beacon, recently came across ancient MCI history books, and discovered
the reason why our school doesn’t have windows. We feel that it is our
journalistic duty to share this information with you, so behold, the
true story of why MCI does not have windows. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MCI was designed in the 1960s by a man known as the Great Baron of
Martingrove, E.N. Closure. His family was of great wealth and status
here in Etobicoke, yet the Baron was the last living member. It’s
important to mention that the Baron’s family had a bitter rivalry with
the other resident affluent family, the Fenetres. The two families had
been disagreeing for centuries, ever since their great grandfathers got
into an argument about the true solution of 1+1. Their dispute resulted
in a violent cheese bread fight, but then ended with a group of geese
chasing them both away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Baron wanted to build a school in his family’s name, to maintain
their legacy. He had many lavish plans for the school: great big
hallways, spacious lockers, adorned with beautiful school colours of
green and white, and most importantly, lots of glorious windows. The
Baron was just about to begin constructing this very school, when he
received the list of students who would be enrolling. All was in order,
until he saw one name at the very bottom of this list: Lisa Fenetre, the
youngest member of the rival Fenetre family. She would be attending
grade 9 at the Baron’s school. This sent the Baron into a fury, and due
to his blind rage towards the Fenetres, he completely scrapped all his
plans for the school. Most notably, he knew that the Fenetres loved
natural light and looking outside, so he decided not to put any windows
in any classrooms. They would only be in the stairwells and at the ends
of the hallways. He wanted Lisa’s school experience to be miserable, and
for her to spend countless hours in math class actually learning what
1+1 is, without distractions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few days later, Lisa Fenetre’s father, Charles, got word of the
Baron’s punishing plans for Lisa and the school. He was outraged, and
went to visit the Baron’s house on a street that was, at the time,
called Summerton. The two had a long fight; one so brutal and cold that
it caused a chill throughout the street. Finally, the Baron couldn’t
tolerate the verbal insults any longer. He went inside his house, and
emerged minutes later with handfuls of Jerry’s hotdogs, which he began
throwing at Mr. Fenetre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Get out of here, get off my property! I’m going to build the most
enclosed school in all of Etobicoke!” shouted the Baron.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And because of the sheer power of Jerry’s hotdogs, Mr. Fenetre was
forced to concede, and return to his own home. The Baron, now unopposed,
was free to proceed with his plans. He built his school of regular
hallways, decorated with dull brown and orange school colors, and no
windows. As desired, he named the school Martingrove, after his own
family’s title.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That year, Lisa Fenetre attended Martingrove in the fall. She, along
with the rest of her family, was repulsed by the lack of windows within
the classrooms. Lisa transferred to Richview three months into the
school year. She went on to live a good life, but never did learn what
1+1 actually equalled. (do you know?!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the triumph of building his school, yet unable to truly punish the
Fenetres, the Baron sadly died at the age of 81. He died due to
excessive consumption of cheese bread, while surrounded by his
collection of computers that never connect to the school wifi. The
Martingrove legacy lives on through his school, and all those who attend
it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On that note, we end the fascinating story of why MCI doesn’t have
windows. We hope you learned something valuable through this story, and
always remember the supremacy of Jerry’s hotdogs. Without them, our
school may not have existed!&lt;/p&gt;

But don’t worry - there’s mutton to fret about.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It all started in Science, last Monday morning,” said the Grade Nine
student. “I was trying to pay attention, and then one of my eyes popped
out.” Eveloin Rib’s eye gracefully leapt from its socket, witnesses
recalled, at 9:07 A.M. on Monday, rolling out the door and into the
hallway. After pausing briefly to look out the window, it made its way
through the Science hallway and tumbled down the stairs, although my
sources do not specify when or how. The whole Science class spent the
morning searching for the rogue eye, with no luck, but at last, Rib’s
eye was found cooling off in a water fountain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like most of Eveloin’s classmates, Hamantha Mince was very relieved.
“I’m just glad Eveloin’s eye was found. It would be unsettling knowing
that a stray eyeball still roams the halls of Meatingrove. “Wouldn’t
that be so unsettling?” said Mince in our interview yesterday. Eveloin
is recovering in the hospital, and she will return to school by Monday.
On behalf of all members here at The Bacon, I am extremely relieved for
both Eveloin and her reunited eye.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As if a runaway eye wasn’t enough for our school last week, The Bacon’s
super top-secret undisclosed headquarters were found ablaze on Tuesday,
with no one at the scene. Although no one was there, sources state that
a math test belonging to Grade Ten student Vee Ande was found
suspiciously close to the cause of the fire: a can of Spam ignited by
pyrokinetic powers. The Spam can appears to remain sealed and unchanged,
so if anyone is looking for a meaty snack during breaktime, The Bacon’s
super top-secret undisclosed headquarters are always open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vee Ande was found the day after in the parking lot, pointing at similar
cans of Spam and muttering to herself, “You meathead, it was just a
misteak,” as she lit them on fire. I’m not pointing any fingers here,
but I am. Thankfully, no one was injured, and the damage from the Spam
fire was minute. It’s safe to say that we avoided being smoked bacon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In international news, the distant relative of Grade Twelve student
Chuck Ram was knighted last week. Chuck’s recount of how he and Sir
Alexhamder Loin OBE are related was a convoluted mess to listen to, but
I will take his word for it. Sir Loin entered knighthood on the 27th of
March at Buckingham Palace, being knighted Officer of the Most Excellent
Order of the Brifish Empire by Queen Elizabeef II, for global
contributions in the field of Physribs. Loin gave a very tender and
heartwarming speech afterwards, followed by a lovely performance of “I
Wanna Hold Your Ham’’ by The Beefles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week was certainly filled with mayham, but we are just happy
everyone is safe and sound.&lt;/p&gt;
