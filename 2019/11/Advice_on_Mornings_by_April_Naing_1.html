    "body": "2019/11/10 - If you’re a Marvel fan like me, then you’ve probably heard about therecent drama between Sony and Disney regarding Spider-Man. If youhaven’t heard about what is happening, here’s a summary. Sony has ownedthe film rights to Spider-Man since 1998. In 2015, they made a deal withDisney, agreeing to lend the character of Spider-Man to Marvel Studios,a company owned by Disney, and to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. As wehave seen over the last few years, Tom Holland’s Spider Man has played alarge role in many Marvel movies. Recently, Sony and Disney haverevisited their deal, and gone through negotiations about future stepsfor the Spider-Man character. On August 20th, 2019, Sony announced thatKevin Feige, president of Marvel Studios, won’t be playing a role in theproduction of the next Spider-Man film. This means that Spider-Man iscurrently not a part of the MCU anymore. This news left fans feelingboth angry and heartbroken, since Marvel’s latest movie, “Spider-Man:Far From Home” had set up Spider-Man to be the new face of thefranchise. Upon hearing about this, I didn’t understand what happenedbetween the two major companies, and wanted to know the reason behindthe decisions being made.   Sony owns the rights to Spider-Man and gets to keep them as long as theymake a new Spider-Man movie every five to six years. They started with“Spider-Man” in 2002, starring Tobey Maguire. After its success, theyproceeded to release “Spider-Man 2”, and then “Spider-Man 3” in 2007. The third movie didn’t do quite as well as hoped, costing $260 millionto make, with profits dipping significantly from the first two movies.   Five years later, Sony decided to reboot the series, and released “TheAmazing Spider-Man” starring Andrew Garfield. This movie made over $700million worldwide. With its success,”The Amazing Spider-Man 2” was made. Unfortunately, it did not live up to Sony’s expectations, with the veryhigh production costs and lessened excitement from fans.   Because of their failed attempts, Sony struck a deal with Disney in  Marvel would be able to use Spider-Man in their cinematicuniverse, while Sony kept distribution rights and creative control. Sonyproducer, Amy Pascal, who played a big role in the creation of theSpider-Man movies since 2002, produced  Spider-Man: Homecoming  and Spider-Man: Far From Home  with Kevin Feige. This deal had beenupheld by both sides, until Sony decided to revisit the idea of makingtheir own Spider-Man films.  Recently, Sony has been doing well with their own ‘Universe of MarvelCharacters’. “Venom” made over $800 million worldwide after beingreleased in 2018, and “Spider-Man: Far From Home” made over $1 billionthis summer. These successes have been “just the rebound Sony needed. ”Spider-Man is Sony’s greatest property, and they are highly motivated tokeep it in their control. . This is why they had such an interest intaking back the character. Another reason why the deal was beingrevisited was because Disney wanted a 50/50 stake in future Spider-Man  movies. Sony wanted to keep the deal as is: where Marvelreceives up to 5% of first-dollar gross and all merchandising revenue. As of right now, no new deal has been made. This indicates that unlesssomething changes, Marvel Studios will not be involved in the making ofnew Spider-Man movies, and no MCU characters will be referenced. Sonyhopes that Director John Watts and star Tom Holland will return for twomore Spider-Man films. Even though this feels like a big loss for fans,we should remember that there are still more movies being made, and eventhough Marvel seems to be out of Spider-Man's life right now, Sony ishopeful that a deal could still be made in the future.   *Note: This article was written before the agreement between Sony andDisney to keep Spiderman in the MCU was reached.

    "body": "2019/11/10 - Remembrance Day Remembrance Day (Jour du Souvenir) is observed annually on November11, the anniversary marking the end of World War 1.   The First World War was the largest conflict the world had ever seen atthe time. The war was a result of many factors, including politicaltension and military alliances. The assassination of Archduke FranzFerdinand of Austria in 1914 sparked the beginning of a crisis and thewar began that same year in August. It would become a bloody four yearwar with close to 61,000 Canadians killed. Originally the day was called “Armistice Day” to commemorate thearmistice agreement which ended the war on Monday, November 11, 1918, at11 a. m, the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month.   Vimy Ridge Considered Canada’s most celebrated Canadian military victory, thebattle of Vimy Ridge was fought from the 9th to 12th of April 1917 onthe Western Front of northern France. Four divisions of the CanadianCorps fought united and captured the ridge from the German army. It wasthe largest territorial advance of any Allied force at that point in thewar. Unfortunately the cost of the victory was overwhelming; more than10,600 Canadians were killed or wounded in the battle. Today a memorialstands at the top of the ridge to honour the 11,285 Canadians killed inFrance throughout the war who have no marked graves. Remembering  The day serves to remember all the lives that were lost in the line ofduty and the countless sacrifices soldiers made to uphold internationalpeace. Historically there is a National Ceremony on the date each year at theNational War Memorial in Ottawa. It is nationally televised and attendedby the Prime Minister, government officials, veterans organizations’representatives, diplomatic representatives, dignitaries, veterans aswell as the general public. What Can You Do? •Remember those who served and the fallen. Honour their sacrifice. •Have a respectful moment of silence •Wear the Remembrance Day symbol, a poppy, with the correct etiquette,that is: on the left over your heart, from the last Friday in Octoberuntil November 11 "

            <!-- Article -->
            <article class="article-post">
                <p>Let’s face it. Most of us aren’t morning people, and with school
starting again a lot of us aren’t used to waking up at the crack of
dawn. Gone are the days when we could sleep until noon and constantly
press “snooze”. However mornings aren’t the worst! In fact, they can
actually be quite nice. They’re quiet and peaceful. The air seems
fresher and catching a sunrise is always a welcome sight. You might even
have a bit of time to be productive! So without further ado, here are
some tips so you can maximize your mornings!</p>

<p><strong>Go to sleep earlier!</strong></p>

<p>This one is pretty straightforward. You need adequate sleep to maintain
your health and sanity! What if you have an assignment? Try sleeping
earlier and then waking up earlier to finish it before school starts.
Help your circadian rhythm by sticking to a regular sleep schedule
including on weekends!</p>

<p><strong>Setting/choosing an alarm</strong></p>

<p>Sure, annoying alarms will get you up but it’ll also put you in a bad
mood to start your morning. It’ll leave you feeling murderous. Talk
about waking up on the wrong side of your bed...</p>

<p><strong>Wake up earlier than you normally do</strong></p>

<p>I find that when my alarm goes off getting up is crucial. Lingering
under your covers might be tempting but it also makes you feel more
sluggish and loses precious time for your body to get used to being
awake before you’re off to class. Force yourself to get out of bed!
It’ll depend on each person but 6am-7am is a good time to wake up.</p>

<p><strong>Open your curtains!</strong></p>

<p>Natural lighting = very good. Crack open your window for fresh air and
to hear the birds chirp!</p>

<p><strong>Put on some music!</strong></p>

<p>Music can set up the atmosphere and instantly improve your mood in the
morning! You could play your favorite jam to get you pumped up or a nice
soundtrack for a calming and happy effect.</p>

<p><strong>Water is your best friend</strong></p>

<p>Your body hasn’t had any water for hours by now! Down a glass of fresh
H₂O to rehydrate and splash your face with cold water to get refreshed.
You can opt for a quick shower too!</p>

<p><strong>Breakfast isn’t negotiable</strong></p>

<p>If you’re like me you’re probably guilty of skipping this vital part of
your mornings. A healthy breakfast improves your memory and mood and
helps you stay concentrated. It’s key for productivity. Recently I’ve
leaned towards a small bowl of cereal or toast, some fruit and a cup of
green tea or coffee!</p>

<p><strong>Exercise</strong></p>

<p>Some people may find a walk or run in the morning really helps
especially in the morning when the air feels fresher. Or just brave an
ice cold shower and get a mini heart attack. A warm shower might just
make your drowsier.</p>

<p><strong>Plan your day!</strong></p>

<p>The key to a good end is a good start! Jot down a to-do list in your
bullet journal, agenda, phone or just think about it on your commute.
Alternatively you can have a morning journal to write your thoughts or
keep track of your dreams.</p>

<p><strong>BONUS (Apps to try out!)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Sleepyti.me:</strong> This is a sleep calculator that really works! You’ll
feel more refreshed in the day if you don’t wake up in the middle of a
sleep cycle. Sleepyti.me helps you to wake up at the optimal time so
that you don’t interrupt any cycles!</p>

<p><strong>WhiteNoise:</strong> WhiteNoise is a free app that gives you a ton of tracks
and calming sounds to choose from that will play from your phone to help
you sleep.</p>

<p><strong>Pacifica:</strong> This one is for if you’re feeling stressed or anxious.
Includes trackers and exercises to try. You can also use it to talk to
others who are feeling the same stress. It’s a free app too!</p>
